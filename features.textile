h1(green). Humble Beginnings

p(soft). For most people, losing weight is not easy. It takes dedication and permanent changes most people are unwilling to make. Diets, boot camps, and other solutions intended to "lose weight quickly" are neither sustainable nor realistic. 
<br />
In reality, eating a healthy diet and staying active requires a change in lifestyle that is neither drastic, nor hard to maintain. But it does take hard work and commitment.
<br />
upower fitness was founded on the idea that if you truly desire change in your life, we can make it happen. Because each individual's needs are unique, we work with each person to craft a unique plan - a plan that's right for their goals.

<section class="content" id="about-2">

h1(light). Power to the Community

p(section-intro ). upower fitness is not just about improving your own life, but also about improving lives of others and the life of the community itself. 
<br />
We partner with a number of local non-profit organizations around Atlanta, and once a month, the proceeds of a u-blast class will go towards a select charity.

p(trainer). Babette Lombardo
%(qual)Founder and Head Trainer
ISSA certified personal trainer, CPR/AED certified%

p(trainer-para). Babette Lombardo, the founder and head trainer of upower Fitness has been able to accomplish this by turning her lifelong love of fitness, athletics and helping others into the movement that is upower fitness.
<br />
Babette grew up in a family that always encouraged her to follow her passion and work as hard as she could at everything she did. Her passion for tennis won her an full athletic scholarship at Jacksonville State University, where she earned her Bachelor of Arts degree. Moving to Atlanta in 2008 after graduation, she worked several years in sports marketing. While her love of athletics never waned and her desire to help others in some meaningful way continued to grow stronger, Babette began to realize her true calling. As her charitable work increased with Kate's Club and her fitness and cycle class instruction took off, Babette searched for ways to combine her desire to help with her passion for healthy living. 
<br />
After some time and a lot of discussion with family and friends, the concept of upower Fitness was born. Babette is eager to share her wealth of information about living a healthy, balanced life while simultaneously giving back to the community.
