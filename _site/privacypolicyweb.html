<p>This Privacy Policy describes how Liztic <span class="caps">LLC</span> (&#8220;<strong>Liztic</strong>&#8221;, &#8220;<strong>we</strong>&#8221;, or &#8220;<strong>us</strong>&#8221;) collects, uses, stores, shares and protects your information in connection with services offered by Liztic including, but not limited to, services provided at or using the domain Liztic.com (the &#8220;<strong>Site</strong>&#8221;); tools or applications including, but not limited to, desktop and other software applications related to the Site (the &#8220;<strong>Applications</strong>&#8221;); images, text, playlists, metadata, and other material available through the Service (the &#8220;<strong>Content</strong>&#8221;); and functionality for transferring sound recordings or embodied musical compositions stored on a device (&#8220;<strong>Audio Files</strong>&#8221;) to another device (collectively, the &#8220;<strong>Service</strong>&#8221;). This Privacy Policy applies when you access, visit or use any portion of the Service. This Privacy Policy is part of, and is governed by, the terms and conditions set forth in the Liztic Terms of Service located at <a href="/termsofservice.html">www.liztic.com/termsofservice.html</a>.</p>
<p>By creating a Liztic Account (as defined in the Terms of Service), or by otherwise accessing, visiting or using the Service, you expressly consent to our collection, use, disclosure and retention of your information as described in this Privacy Policy and in the Liztic Terms of Service.</p>
<p>We may amend this Privacy Policy from time to time. You may be required to accept the amended Privacy Policy upon logging in to your Liztic Account in order to keep using the Service. Alternatively, we may post any material changes to this Privacy Policy on the Site with a notice advising of the changes in advance of the effective date of the changes. We may also notify you of material changes to this Privacy Policy by sending an email to the email address associated with your Liztic Account before the effective date of the changes. We encourage you to keep the email address associated with your Liztic Account current, and to promptly notify us of any changes to your email address, so that you may receive any notices we send to you regarding material changes to this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>If you do not agree to the new Privacy Policy, you may terminate your Liztic Account within the applicable thirty (30) day period and you will not be bound by the new terms. Otherwise, the new terms will take effect after thirty (30) days.</p>

	<li><strong>Information Collected by Liztic.</strong>
	<ol>
		<li class="alpha"><strong>Information You Provide to Us.</strong><br />
We may collect information that you provide to us in connection with your use of the Service when you (i) register as a user of the Service; (ii) make changes to your user profile information; or (iii) send e-mail messages, forms, or other information to us through the Service. When you register for a Liztic Account, you will be required to provide your email address and create a password. You may also choose to provide additional information in connection with your Liztic Account, including your full name and a referral code. If you elect to purchase a Paid Subscription (as defined in the Terms of Service), you may need to provide payment information, including a payment card number, and related security code, expiration date, and cardholder name and billing and shipping addresses. We do not store your payment card information. We process all payment transactions through a third party merchant services provider. We may collect information about your purchases and associate it with your Liztic Account.</li>
		<li class="alpha"><strong>Information We Collect From Social Media Services.</strong> <br />
Users may post content to Social Media Services (as defined in the Terms of Service) through the Service and post content to the Service through Social Media Services. If you associate an account on a Social Media Service with your Liztic Account, you give Liztic permission to access, store and use any information that you permit the applicable Social Media Service to share with Liztic and that the applicable Social Media Service has made available to Liztic in accordance with your privacy settings with the applicable Social Media Service. This information (including without limitation, your name, photographs, geographic location, birthday and any content that you post to the Social Media Service) may be displayed on the Service while you are logged on to the Service. We encourage you to review, and if necessary, adjust, your privacy settings with the applicable Social Media Service before associating your Social Media Service account with your Liztic Account. Information that Liztic receives from Social Media Services is stored and used by Liztic in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</li>
	</ol></li>
	<li><strong>Information Automatically Collected Through the Service.</strong><br />
Liztic, along with our third party service partners, vendors and business partners may automatically collect information about you when you use the Service. The information automatically collected about you may include, but is not limited to, device ID, device type, browser type and version, geo-location information, computer and connection information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from the Service, ad data, IP address, and standard web log information. Some of our third party service partners, vendors and business partners allow you to opt-out from the automatic collection of your information.</li>
	<li><strong>Cookies, Web Beacons, and Stored Passwords.</strong> <br />
Liztic, along with our third party service partners, vendors and business partners may use cookies, locally stored objects and web beacons to automatically collect information about your use of the Service. Cookies are small bits of information that are transferred to and stored in separate files within your computer’s browser. The Service may store both &#8220;persistent cookies&#8221; which remain on your computer after you have closed your browser as well as &#8220;session cookies&#8221; which exist only during a visitor’s online session and disappear from your device when you close the Application or browser. Locally stored objects or &#8220;flash cookies&#8221; are data files that can be created on your computer or mobile device by the websites you visit and are a way for websites to store information for later use. Locally stored objects are different than cookies because they are stored in different parts of your device than cookies. Web beacons are small strings of code that provide a method for delivering a graphic image on a web page or in an email message for the purpose of transferring data. You may be able to set your browser to reject cookies or to notify you when you are sent a cookie. You may also be able to disable the storage of flash cookies. For additional information about managing and disabling flash cookies, please visit <a href="http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html">http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/disable-local-shared-objects-flash.html</a>. However, if you reject cookies or disable flash cookies you may not be able to use all portions or all functionality of the Service. Applications provided by Liztic for accessing the Service may also store your password locally in encrypted form to facilitate ease of access to the Service.</li>

		<li class="alpha"><strong>Law Enforcement Authorities.</strong> <br />
To the extent permitted by law, we may share your information with law enforcement, governmental agencies, or authorized third-parties, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity or any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other Liztic user to legal liability, or to protect our rights or property, or during emergencies when safety is at risk.</li>

Liztic takes reasonable measures to protect the information you provide to Liztic or submit through the Service against loss, theft and unauthorized use, disclosure, or modification. However, we cannot guarantee or warrant the security of any information you transmit to Liztic or submit through the Service and you do so at your own risk.
