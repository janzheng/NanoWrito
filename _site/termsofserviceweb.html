The Service allows users to synchronize their music libraries and playlists across their devices. The Service is not a &#8220;music locker&#8221; and does not provide functionality for saving, posting, uploading, transferring, or otherwise storing Audio Files on the Site or any other portion of the Service. Any functionality provided by the Service for transferring Audio Files between devices is implemented using wireless transfer protocols or other direct transfer technologies. The Service is intended for users who are at least thirteen (13) years old or children under the age of thirteen (13) under the supervision of a parent or guardian.

We encourage you to keep the email address associated with your Liztic Account current, and to promptly notify us of any changes to your email address, so that you may receive any notices we send to you regarding material changes to these Terms of Service. <br />

<div>
	<ul>
		<li>Basic Subscription (Free);</li>
		<li>Premium Subscription (Paid); and</li>
		<li>Studio Subscription (Paid).<br />
</div><br />
The Basic Subscription allows a Liztic Account holder to synchronize a maximum of 250 Audio Files across a maximum of three devices. The Premium Subscription allows a Liztic Account holder to synchronize a maximum of 2,500 Audio Recordings across a maximum of five devices. The Studio Subscription allows a Liztic Account holder to synchronize an unlimited number of Audio Recordings across a maximum of ten devices. When you create your Liztic Account, you will automatically receive a Basic Subscription. You may upgrade your Basic Subscription to a Premium Subscription or a Studio Subscription (collectively, &#8220;<strong>Paid Subscriptions</strong>&#8221;) at any time.
		<ol>
			<li class="alpha"><strong>Subscription Fee Payment.</strong> <br />
You must associate a valid payment method with your Liztic Account to receive a Paid Subscription. You may pay for a Paid Subscription in monthly increments or annual increments (your &#8220;Subscription Period&#8221;). If you have a Paid Subscription, your payment to Liztic will automatically renew at the end of your Subscription Period and the payment method associated with your Liztic Account will be charged the cost of the subscription for the subsequent Subscription Period (the &#8220;Subscription Fees&#8221;). . To avoid automatic renewal, you may cancel your Paid Subscription before the end of your current Subscription Period. If you cancel your Paid Subscription, the cancellation will take effect the day after the last day of your current Subscription Period, and your subscription will be downgraded to the Basic Subscription. If you have a Studio Subscription, you may downgrade your subscription to a Premium Subscription before the end of your current Subscription Period, and the payment method associated with your account will be charged the Subscription Fees for the Premium Subscription effective at the beginning of the next Subscription Period. If your Subscription Period is monthly, your cancellation or downgrade request must be received five (5) business days prior to the end of your Subscription Period. If your Subscription Period is annual, your cancellation or downgrade request must be received one (1) calendar month prior to the end of your Subscription.</li>
			<li class="alpha"><strong>Refunds.</strong> <br />
If your Subscription Period is annual and you cancel your Paid Subscription within thirty (30) days after the date that your payment method is charged the Subscription Fee, you will be issued a prorated refund of the Subscription Fee. No refunds will be issued more than thirty (30) days after your payment method has been charged the Subscription Fee. Unless required by law, no refunds of Subscription Fees will be issued if your Subscription Period is monthly.</li>
			<li class="alpha"><strong>Change in Subscription Fees.</strong> <br />
Liztic may change the Subscription Fees for the Paid Subscriptions or the Per-Device Fees from time to time (&#8220;<strong>Fee Changes</strong>&#8221;), and will communicate any such changes to you. Fee changes will take effect at the start of the next Subscription Period following the date of the price change. By continuing to use the Service after the change takes effect, you accept the new fees.</li>
			<li class="alpha"><strong>Invalid Payment Method.</strong> <br />
If you have a Paid Subscription and Liztic is unable to charge your Subscription Fees to the payment method associated with your Liztic Account due to the expiration, invalidity, or rejection of your payment method, Liztic will send you a message at the email address associated with your Liztic Account notifying you that Liztic&#8217;s attempt to charge your Subscription Fees and/or your Per-Device Fees (collectively, &#8220;<strong>Fees Owed</strong>&#8221;) to your payment method was unsuccessful. Upon receiving such message, you should log in to your Liztic Account and update your payment method. Fifteen (15) days after such unsuccessful attempt, Liztic will attempt to charge your Fees Owed to your payment method a second time. If such second attempt is unsuccessful, your Paid Subscription will automatically be downgraded to a Basic Subscription and Liztic will send you a message at the email address associated with your Liztic Account notifying you of such downgrade.</li>
			<li class="alpha"><strong>Codes and other Limited Offers.</strong> <br />
If you have received a code sold by or on behalf of Liztic for access to a Paid Subscription for the time period indicated on your email, card, or paper receipt (&#8220;<strong>Code</strong>&#8221;), or if you are accessing the Service through some other limited offer which you received as a gift or purchased from Liztic (&#8220;<strong>Limited Offer</strong>&#8221;), these Terms of Service apply to your access to the Service. Any separate sets of terms and conditions presented to you along with the Code or Limited Offer also apply to your access to the Service using the Code or Limited Offer.

	<li><strong>Indemnity.</strong> <br />
You agree to indemnify and hold the Liztic Parties harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys&#8217; fees, made by any third party due to or arising out of: (A) your use of the Service, the User Content, the Audio Files, or the Content; (B) your violation of these Terms of Service; or &#169; your violation of any law or your violation or infringement of any rights of another party.</li>
	<li><strong>Choice of Law and Forum.</strong> <br />
The laws of the State of Georgia apply to these Terms of Service and to your relationship with the Liztic Parties, without regard to conflict of law principles, and the parties irrevocably consent to bring any action to enforce these Terms of Service in the federal or state courts located in Atlanta, Georgia.

	<li><strong>Arbitration Agreement and Waiver of Class Remedies.</strong>
	<ol>
		<li class="alpha"><strong>Arbitration.</strong> <br />
The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration. All claims arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service (including its formation, performance and breach) and your use of the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (&#8220;<strong><span class="caps">AAA</span></strong>&#8221;) in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules and the supplementary procedures for consumer related disputes of the <span class="caps">AAA</span>, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Service, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Service is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator&#8217;s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds the cost of filing a lawsuit, we will pay the additional cost.The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</li>
		<li class="alpha"><strong>Class Action Waiver.</strong> <br />
The parties further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this Section 23B is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</li>
		<li class="alpha"><strong>Exception- Litigation of Small Claims Court Claims.</strong> <br />
Notwithstanding the parties&#8217; decision to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may also seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the se of that court&#8217;s jurisdiction.</li>
		<li class="alpha"><strong>Thirty Day Right to Opt Out.</strong> <br />
You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth this Section 23D by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following address: Liztic <span class="caps">LLC</span>, 227 Sandy Springs Place, Suite 520, Atlanta, GA 30328, <span class="caps">USA</span>. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of registering to use the Service, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms set forth above. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them. In addition, if you elect to opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we may terminate your use of the Service.</li>
	</ol></li>

Except as explicitly stated otherwise, legal notices shall be served on Liztic&#8217;s national registered agent (in the case of Liztic) or, in your case, to the email address associated with your Liztic Account. Notice to you shall be deemed given twenty-four (24) hours after the email is sent.</li>

You may not assign or delegate any right or obligation you have under these Terms of Service, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Liztic. Liztic may assign or delegate any right or obligation under these Terms of Service, whether by operation of law or otherwise, without your consent.</li>
	<li><strong>Waiver and Severability.</strong> <br />
Our failure to exercise or enforce any of these Terms of Service or to act with respect to a breach by you or others will not constitute a waiver and does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches. If any provision of these Terms of Use is held to be invalid, void or unenforceable under applicable law, then the applicable provision will be construed, limited, modified or, if necessary, severed to the extent necessary to eliminate its unenforceability.</li>

	<li><strong>Export Control.</strong> <br />
